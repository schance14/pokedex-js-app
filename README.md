Project Description:

    This Pokedex App is a simple web application that uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to load data from an external API while also utilizing jQuery and Bootstrap. Using these tools, this application will load data to show a list of Pokemon where you can then view more details on each one by clicking on a Pokemon from the list.

Reflections: 

    As the sole developer on this project, I learned how to bring functionality to a web application using JavaScript while also incorporating jQuery and Bootstrap to elevate the overall styling and performance. I learned throughout this project that practice is key when learning a new programming language as well as seeking out many different resources to find answers and new ways to understand key concepts that were taught throughout these exercises.


Technologies Used:
- HTML: To create the structure of the application
- CSS: To create the design/styling
- Bootstrap: To elevate and cleanup the overall style of the application
- JavaScript: To provide functionality to the application
- jQuery: Paired with JavaScript to allow for more seamless functionality and easy to read code
